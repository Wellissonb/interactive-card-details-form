### What I learned


```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('I learned how to leave an element with a visible display and then give it opacity 1, so that it occupies the space it needs and appears little by little. I used setTimeOut')

  container.style.display = 'flex'
  setTimeOut(()=>{
    container.style.opacity = '1'
  },1)

}
```
